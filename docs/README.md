# Info panel

> Info panel is a webapp that displays basic information such as weather, buss departures, calendar and news articles in one place at all times. It is meant to be used on a screen at home to remove the need for opening multiple apps each morning.


## Docs

> To adapt this app for personal use you will need to modify the api requests in each self.get() function which resides in lib/* so that it matches your location/buss stop.
